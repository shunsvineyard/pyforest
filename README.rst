The Forest in Python
====================

The Forest is a tree data structure library for fun and also used as an example for Sphinx, and my Python working environment.

The Forest contains the following tree data structures:

- Binary Trees
    - AVL Tree
    - Binary Search Tree
    - Red Black Tree
    - Threaded Binary Tree
- B Tree

The Forest also provides the tree traversal feature to traverse binary trees and generic trees.

- Binary Tree Traversal
    - In-order
    - Out-order
    - Pre-order
    - Post-order
    - Level-order
- Generic Tree Traversal
    - Breadth First Search
    - Depth First Search

Requirements
------------

The Forest uses the standard Python library as much as possible, but it does have the following dependencies:

- Python 3.7
- pytest (for unit test)
- Sphinx (for documents)
