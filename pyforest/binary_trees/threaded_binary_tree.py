"""Threaded Binary Tree module.

Threaded binary tree is a binary search tree variant that optimize traversal
in a particular order by making all right child of leaf nodes pointer to
their in-order successor of the node (if it exists). There are two types
of threaded binary tree:
- Single Threaded
- Double Threaded
